Pi means Raspberry Pi
Run means type into terminal and press enter.
ALWAYS EDIT FILES IN NOTEPAD++


-Format SD-Card using Raspberry Pi Imager. Install Raspbian.

-Plug SD-Card into Pi and power it on. Wait 30 seconds.


Two ways to start. Either:
	1. Turn off Pi and plug SD-Card into computer.

	2. Add file named "ssh" no extension to Root of SD.

	3. Open wpa_supplicant.conf file in Setup Files. Edit 
		ssid and psk variables (ssid is the name of the 
		wifi you connect to, psk is the password).
	
	4. Copy wpa_supplicant.conf to Root of SD.

	5. Eject SD, plug into Pi and power on.

	6. SSH into Pi using "ssh pi@raspberrypi.local" in terminal.
	
Or easier/error prone method:
	1. Connect Pi to HDMI and wired keyboard.
	
	2. Wait for GUI to show up on display.
	
	3. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to open terminal.


******************************************************************
-Run "sudo raspi-config".

-In Localization Options, configure keyboard. Make sure it matches
	the country and brand if possible.

-In System Options, configure Wireless LAN, Audio, Hostname, 
	Password, and Boot / Auto Login (select Console Autologin).
	
-In Interface Options, enable SSH.

-Run "sudo apt update".

-Run "sudo apt-get install mpg321" for mp3 file.

-Reboot using "sudo reboot".
	

****************************************************************
-Open windows terminal and navigate to directory before RaspVideo folder
	using cd (change directory) and dir (list directory).
	
-Transfer VLCP.py and bumper.mp3 to Pi using "scp VLCP.py bumper.mp3 pi@caelohm.local:~/Documents/"
	(hostname for other people).
	
-Turn off Raspberry Pi. Plug micro-sd into computer and 
	replace config.txt file in root directory.
	

****************************************************************
-Transfer windows video files to Videos using "scp -r <space separated folder names to transfer> pi@caelohm.local:~/Videos/"
	in directory of Videos you want to transfer. WARNING: Pi Zero W does not support H.265 codec, must convert to H.264.
	
****************************************************************
-Open ~/.bashrc with nano. Navigate to the bottom of the file and add:
	cd <directory where VLCP.py and bumper.mp3 are located>
	python3 VLCP.py
	
	This will start the program at boot.
	
****************************************************************
-That is basically it! You may have to install some package that is used in VLCP.py. If you do, run sudo pip3 install <package>.


EXTRA:
-ssh into Pi from terminal in Windows using "ssh pi@hostname.local"
	**If this doesn't work, make sure Pi is connected to wifi using "iwgetid".
	Make sure windows is connected to the same network and isn't using
	a vpn. Try in new windows terminal. If that doesn't work, run 
	"sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon" and make sure Bonjour is installed 
	on Windows. If that doesn't work, delete "known_hosts" in C:\Users\<user>\.ssh\
	If it STILL doesn't work, find raspberry pi ip using "ifconfig".
	The Pi ip is next to inet. Replace hostname with ip (not preferred).**
	
-Apparently, to reference a file with spaces in bash (scp), you have to put the path
	in two quotations, ie. "'<path>'".
	
-You can also use rsync in Ubuntu terminal instead of scp. Windows files are located in 
	/mnt/ directory of Ubuntu. If you do it this way, rsync will change the color of the files 
	for the worse. This is because of write permissions. Use this command to reset the file colors:
		find . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 755
	Or just leave it, it's not a big deal.
	
		rsync -av --ignore-existing --progress <source> <destination> 
	will skip existing files.
